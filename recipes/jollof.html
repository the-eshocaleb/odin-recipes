        <li>5 Tablespoonful tomato paste(very important)</li>
        <li>4 whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper (tatashe)</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnets peppers/atarodo</li>
        <li>100ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li>About 600ml Meat or Chicken stock</li>
        <li>A small onion (sliced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoonful ground crayfish(optional)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon each of Thyme and curry</li>
        <li>2 small Bay leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 stock cube</li>
        <li>Water, as needed(details in recipe below)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. Add to the mixture that was set aside and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</li>
    </ol>
